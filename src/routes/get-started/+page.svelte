        Creating an account is free and fast. You can create a new account on the fly if you don't
        already have one. Please input all the required details and you will be logged in to the
        service as a new user. Remember the email address you used to sign up to the system, as you
        will need it when joining a group, or requesting a new group for your organization in the
        next step.

      <p>
        At the core of access control on <A href="https://ioxio.io">IOXIO.io</A> are groups. Every data
        source belongs to a group, and groups request access to consume data from data sources controlled
        by other groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each user can join an organization's existing group or request a new group. For <A
          href="https://ioxio.io">IOXIO.io</A
        >
        these groups can be requested via email or through our <A href="https://slack.ioxio.com"
          >community Slack</A
        >. For fastest verification of your group, please send an email to <A
          href="mailto:support@ioxio.com">support@ioxio.com</A
        > and tell us the name of the group you would like to be created for you.

      title="Start sharing data"
      index="3"
      action={{ title: "Share data", href: "https://developer.ioxio.io/sources/my-sources" }}
    >
      <p>Data sharing is free, and you can share your data as soon as you have a group set up.</p>
      <p>
        Once you have an API that follows one of the existing data definitions on <A
          href="https://ioxio.io">IOXIO.io</A
        > you can start sharing your data! Check out the available data definitions from the <A
          href="https://gateway.ioxio.io/redoc">definition viewer</A
        >. If you can't find a definition that covers your use case, please contact us at
        <A href="mailto:support@ioxio.com">support@ioxio.com</A> or through our <A
          href="https://slack.ioxio.com">community Slack</A
        > and describe your usecase, so we can solve the problem together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have created the API, you can log in to the Dataspace to publish your data source.
