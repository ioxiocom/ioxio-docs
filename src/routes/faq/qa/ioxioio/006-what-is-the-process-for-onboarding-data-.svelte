    What is the process for onboarding data providers and developers onto IOXIO.io?
  </svelte:fragment>
  
  <svelte:fragment slot="answer">
    <p>Our process is very simple! Once you have an API that follows one of the data productâ€™s definitions that the Dataspace offers, you only need to register an account, create or join a group, and connect your API to the Dataspace.</p>
<p>To get started you can check out our <a href="https://docs.ioxio.dev/get-started">getting started page</a>.</p>
