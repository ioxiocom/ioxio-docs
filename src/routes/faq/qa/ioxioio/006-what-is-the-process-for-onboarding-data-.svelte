<FAQ question={"What is the process for onboarding data providers and developers onto IOXIO.io?"}>
  <p>
    Our process is very simple! Once you have an API that follows one of the data product's
    definitions that the Dataspace offers, you only need to register an account, create or join a
    group, and connect your API to the Dataspace.
