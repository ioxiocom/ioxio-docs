<FAQ question={"What is the process for onboarding data providers and developers onto IOXIO.io?"}>
  <p>
    Our process is very simple! Once you have an API that follows one of the data productâ€™s
    definitions that the Dataspace offers, you only need to register an account, create or join a
    group, and connect your API to the Dataspace.
