    Whatâ€™s the difference between track and trace platforms and a dataspace?
  </svelte:fragment>

  <svelte:fragment slot="answer">
    <p>
      Dataspaces play a crucial role in enabling and enhancing track and trace platforms, which are
      systems designed to monitor the life cycle of goods, materials, or information across supply
      chains or ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relationship lies in the ability of a dataspace to provide the infrastructure for seamless
      data sharing, integration, and collaboration among diverse stakeholders, which are essential
      for effective track and trace functionalities. Dataspaces enable track and trace platforms to
      function reliably with harmonized data by providing the platform for data sharing to track and
      trace platforms.
