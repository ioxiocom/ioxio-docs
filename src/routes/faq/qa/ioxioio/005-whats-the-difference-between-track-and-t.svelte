<FAQ question={"Whatâ€™s the difference between track and trace platforms and a dataspace?"}>
  <p>
    Dataspaces play a crucial role in enabling and enhancing track and trace platforms, which are
    systems designed to monitor the life cycle of goods, materials, or information across supply
    chains or ecosystems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The relationship lies in the ability of a dataspace to provide the infrastructure for seamless
    data sharing, integration, and collaboration among diverse stakeholders, which are essential for
    effective track and trace functionalities. Dataspaces enable track and trace platforms to
    function reliably with harmonized data by providing the platform for data sharing to track and
    trace platforms.
