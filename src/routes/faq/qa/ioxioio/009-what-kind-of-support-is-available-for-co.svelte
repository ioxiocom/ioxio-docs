    We have our <A href="https://slack.ioxio.dev">open community Slack</A> where you can come chat with
    us and ask help from our core developers, or use our support email at
    <A href="mailto:support@ioxio.com">support@ioxio.com</A>. We also offer consultation services to
    help companies tackle different kinds of data sharing problems, so if you need help defining
    your data sharing cases, data structure or anything else data related, or in just getting on top
    of your general data sharing capabilities, get in touch via email at
    <A href="mailto:sales@ioxio.com">sales@ioxio.com</A>.
