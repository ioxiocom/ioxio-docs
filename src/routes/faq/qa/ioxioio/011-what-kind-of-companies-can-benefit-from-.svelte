    What kind of companies can benefit from using IOXIO Dataspace™?
  </svelte:fragment>
  
  <svelte:fragment slot="answer">
    <p>Any companies that need collaborative API based data sharing can greatly benefit from operating on a Dataspace! Lately we have have been working with e.g. manufacturing, transportation, battery and textile industries to do supply chain reporting and ESG reporting that requires connecting multiple sources of data.</p>
<p>Digital product passports are setting a lot of requirements for different industries operating within the EU, and we aim to provide tools for tackling the complicated landscape for everyone. If we don’t cover your use cases yet, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@ioxio.com">sales@ioxio.com</a> so we can see what kind of data products we could offer for you.</p>
