<FAQ question={"What kind of companies can benefit from using IOXIO Dataspaceâ„¢?"}>
  <p>
    Any companies that need collaborative API based data sharing can greatly benefit from operating
    on a Dataspace! Lately we have have been working with e.g. manufacturing, transportation,
    battery and textile industries to do supply chain reporting and ESG reporting that requires
    connecting multiple sources of data.

  <p>
    Digital product passports are setting a lot of requirements for different industries operating
    within the EU, and we aim to provide tools for tackling the complicated landscape for everyone.
    If we don't cover your use cases yet, you can contact us at <A href="mailto:sales@ioxio.com"
