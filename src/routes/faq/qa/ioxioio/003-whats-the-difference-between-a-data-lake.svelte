<FAQ question={"Whatâ€™s the difference between a data lake or a data warehouse and a dataspace?"}>
  <p>
    Unlike data lakes or data warehouses, which store data in a centralized repository, <a
      href="http://ioxio.io/">IOXIO.io</a
    > data sharing service provides a federated approach where data remains with its original owner and
    is transferred only on demand based on predefined rules and agreements. This ensures greater data
    control, privacy, and compliance with regulations like GDPR.
