<FAQ question={"Will I get vendor locked into IOXIO.io?"}>
  <p>
    No, since you will always keep your data, and we always allow you to just start creating your
    own API integrations if you for whatever reason feel that using <a href="http://IOXIO.io"
      >IOXIO.io</a
    > isn’t for you. Using IOXIO.io doesn’t limit your data sharing in any way outside of the integrations
    you make to the IOXIO.io, and the API implementations required are not special to IOXIO.io or our
    dataspace technology.
