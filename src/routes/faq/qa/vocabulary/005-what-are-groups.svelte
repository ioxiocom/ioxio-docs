<FAQ question={"What are groups?"}>
  <p>
    Groups are the way for managing access to data sources on the dataspace. Everything, and
    everyone needs to be part of one or more groups in order to share and consume data on our
    service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Groups have members who can use them, and owners who can manage the groups and the members of
    the group. Groups are the basic unit of access control for data sources.
