<FAQ question={"What is a dataspace?"}>
  <p>
    Dataspace is the generic name of data sharing environments similar like IOXIO.io. It is an
    environment for data standardization, communication, control and sharing which ensures
    interoperability of data between multiple parties, and ensures the data is harmonized between
    different providers of data so consuming similar data from different parties can be as straight
    forward as possible. Read more about it on our <A href="https://docs.ioxio.dev/dataspace/"
      >dataspace page</A
    >.
