<FAQ question={"What kind of data definitions are available?"}>
  <p>
    You can find the up-to-date list of available data definitions from the “Data definitions” link
    in the menu. We have been prioritizing industrial use-cases, so you can at least find data
    definitions e.g. around cargo, sustainability, and operational metrics, as well as data that
    helps give more meaning to those things.

  <p>
    If you have an idea what kind of data you would like to share, you can always suggest a data
    product to us either on our <a href="https://slack.ioxio.com">community Slack</a>, or directly
    via <a href="https://github.com/ioxio-dataspace/ioxio-io-definitions/">GitHub.</a>
