    Can I use any type of data?

  <svelte:fragment slot="answer">
    <p>We currently allow data sharing using JSON POST APIs and following our Data Definitions. If the data follows an available definition, and is available with a JSON POST API, it is supported. Other protocols are planned and will be prioritized when there is enough customer demand.</p>
<p>If you have other use cases in mind, that you think the Dataspace should be able to support feel free to contact us, and weâ€™ll see what can be done to solve your unique challenge!</p>
