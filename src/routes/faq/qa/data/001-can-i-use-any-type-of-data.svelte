<FAQ question={"Can I use any type of data?"}>
  <p>
    We currently allow data sharing using JSON POST APIs and following our Data Definitions. If the
    data follows an available definition, and is available with a JSON POST API, it is supported.
    Other protocols are planned and will be prioritized when there is enough customer demand.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have other use cases in mind, that you think the Dataspace should be able to support feel
    free to contact us, and weâ€™ll see what can be done to solve your unique challenge!
