<FAQ question={"Are you IDSA compliant?"}>
  <p>
    We are members of IDSA and share the IDSA ideology in terms of sovereign data exchange for
    organizations and individuals. Our architecture is based on similar principles, but is not
    strictly following the IDSA architecture. We are offering our solution as an alternative way of
    seeing things to the IDSA community. Our solution for security and verification of parties is
    more based on common internet technologies with less work required for parties to integrate into
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally we have a strong focus on standardizing the data structures and APIs in the
    dataspace to ensure interoperability between parties, which is completely missing from the IDSA
    work right now.
