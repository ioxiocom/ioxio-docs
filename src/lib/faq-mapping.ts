    "question": "What’s the difference between a data lake or a data warehouse and a dataspace?",
    "answer": "Unlike data lakes or data warehouses, which store data in a centralized repository, [IOXIO.io](http://ioxio.io/) data sharing service provides a federated approach where data remains with its original owner and is transferred only on demand based on predefined rules and agreements. This ensures greater data control, privacy, and compliance with regulations like GDPR."

    "filename": "What’s the difference between a cloud storage serv 1d88e3ae865b8041b0ccf82c7370c203.md",
    "question": "What’s the difference between a cloud storage services and a dataspace?",
    "answer": "While a dataspace and a cloud storage service are two entirely different things, the key difference lies in how data is stored and managed. Cloud services typically store data on remote servers, providing users with the ability to access, manage, and process their information directly within the cloud environment. This makes cloud services an ideal choice for centralized storage and computation needs.\n\nIn contrast, a dataspace operates as an intermediary rather than a storage solution. It does not store your data but instead facilitates secure and efficient interactions between different parties who want to use or share data, and to standardize different data products. A dataspace ensures that data remains under the control of its respective owners, enabling collaboration and data exchange without compromising ownership or privacy.\n\nThis distinction makes dataspaces particularly suitable for scenarios where data sovereignty, controlled sharing and interoperability are crucial, while cloud services are more aligned with centralized storage and processing requirements."

    "question": "What’s the difference between track and trace platforms and a dataspace?",
    "answer": "Dataspaces play a crucial role in enabling and enhancing track and trace platforms, which are systems designed to monitor the life cycle of goods, materials, or information across supply chains or ecosystems.\n\nThe relationship lies in the ability of a dataspace to provide the infrastructure for seamless data sharing, integration, and collaboration among diverse stakeholders, which are essential for effective track and trace functionalities. Dataspaces enable track and trace platforms to function reliably with harmonized data by providing the platform for data sharing to track and trace platforms."

    "question": "What are Digital Product Passports and IOXIO Tags™️?",
    "answer": "A Digital Product Passport (DPP) is an electronic record that contains detailed information about a product’s lifecycle, including its materials, production, usage, repair history, and recyclability. It enables traceability, transparency, and sustainability by providing consumers, businesses, and regulators with real-time access to a product’s key data.\n\nDigital Product Passports are an upcoming EU requirement for different industries to be able to operate within the EU. Everybody selling goods inside EU will need to be able to track and present data through the entire supply chain of their product from the initial creation of the materials to the assembly and sale of the product. In order for you to be able to do this, you will need to combine a lot of different data points for your product. \n\nOur [IOXIO Tags™️](https://docs.ioxio.dev/tags/) protocol is a solution that allows you to use different data providers on a dataspace to combine all of them into one report, and link it onto a physical carrier like QR code or an RFID yarn."

The data sources may choose to use this information to limit access to applications they trust. These API keys can easily be shared by developers as they choose, and it does not require the Dataspace to be involved.\n\n# Authorization via login\n\n**This method is considered functional, but not recommended, and is only available on test environments ⚠️**\n\nSome of our Dataspaces offer end-user authentication for applications, and we have standards for passing through the authentication information from applications to data sources. Providing these tokens can be a valid means of authentication. However, it should be kept in mind that the security provided by this is only as strong as the login provider, and in our test environments (e.g. Sandbox and Testbed) there is *zero* security provided by the login provider.\n\nThe security of the method used has not been strongly verified, and is likely still flawed.\n\n# Consenting\n\n**This method is considered functional, but not recommended, and is only available on test environments ⚠️**\n\nWe have an experimental “consent protocol” developed where end-users may choose to consent to certain applications accessing certain data products related to them in certain data sources. This means it requires the application, the end-user, and the data source to be identified.\n\nThe system is not actively maintained. There are some bugs we expect to have with the system right now, and it cannot be considered stable and reliable as it is.\n\nThe consent portal, which is required for the use of our consent protocol, has only been deployed for our test Dataspaces (e.g. Sandbox and Testbed).\n\n# HTTP Signatures\n\n**This method is considered not yet fully functional 🛑**\n\nWe’ve tested using the IETF HTTP Message Signatures -draft standard for verifying the data transfer between applications and data sources. This would allow identifying of the parties involved, and then do appropriate decisions based on that information. It would also function as proof of receipt later if necessary.\n\nThis functionality, once fully developed, would require the parties (application and data source developers) to publish their signing keys over JWKS and register them on the Dataspace, but besides that should work on every Dataspace.\n\nThis feature has been prototyped and security provided by it has not been fully evaluated, but when a need rises, it will be easy enough to take into real use.\n\n# Verifiable credentials\n\n**This method is considered not yet fully functional 🛑**\n\nThe overall goal is to provide a method of proving digitally various real-world privileges and permissions, e.g. that you have a driver’s license, or you have the signing rights for a company.\n\nThis work has only been drafted on a high level and isn’t finalized, but the goal is to standardize this kind of information structures, and the way of sharing them, possibly using digital wallets as a medium."
